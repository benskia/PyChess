# PyChess

Simulates a game of chess.

## How to Play

The game is currently played in the terminal, and inputs are restricted to
algebraic notation. For example, "Nb1c3" moves white's Knight at b1 to c3.

## Roadmap

* Pawns can move two spaces as first movement.
* Pawns can capture on diagonal and only on diagonal.
* Check(mate) logic
* Castling
